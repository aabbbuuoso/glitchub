Here's how to connect Glitch and Github together:

1. Go to [glitch.com](http://glitch.com) and create a new `hello-express` app.
2. Open the `package.json` file and add the following packages:

  - `node-cmd`
  - `body-parser`

3. Go to your `server.js` file load the following libraries:

```js
const cmd = require('node-cmd');
const crypto = require('crypto'); 
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
```

4. Look for `app.use(express.static('public'));` and add the following line below:

`app.use(bodyParser.json())`

5. Create a post endpoint to receive the Github webhook:

```js
const onWebhook = (req, res) => {
  let hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha1', process.env.SECRET);
  let sig  = `sha1=${hmac.update(JSON.stringify(req.body)).digest('hex')}`;

  if (req.headers['x-github-event'] === 'push' && sig === req.headers['x-hub-signature']) {
    cmd.run('chmod 777 ./git.sh'); 
    
    cmd.get('./git.sh', (err, data) => {  
      if (data) {
        console.log(data);
      }
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
    })

    cmd.run('refresh');
  }

  return res.sendStatus(200);
}

app.post('/git', onWebhook);
```

6. Open the `.env` file and set a SECRET:

```bash
SECRET=cirrus-socrates-particle-decibel-hurricane-dolphin-tulip
```

7. Create a `git.sh` file and add:

```bash
#/bin/sh

# Fetch the newest code
git fetch origin master

# Hard reset
git reset --hard origin/master

# Force pull
git pull origin master --force
```

*This file will be in charge of pulling the changes from your Github repo.*

8. Open the glitch console for your project and generate a new SSH key with:

```bash 
ssh-keygen
```

*Just press `<Enter>` to accept all the questions.*

9. Read the content of the `.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file:

```bash 
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

*Then copy the string to your clipboard.*

10. Create a new Github repo with a `README.me` file (or any other file, it's important that the project is not empty)
11. Go to the 'deploy keys' section of the settings page of your project.
12. Click on 'Add deploy key' and add the SSH key you generated before in the key field and 'glitch.com' in the title field.
13. Check the 'Allow write access' box too.
14. Now open the webhooks section and add a new webhook:

```markdown
**Payload URL**: `https://PROJECT_NAME.glitch.me/git`
**Content type**: `application/json`
**Secret**: `use the SECRET you set up in your glitch project`
```
*The rest of the defaults are ok.*

15. Go back to your glitch project and click export your project to GitHub.
16. Clone your repo in your dev machine and merge the `glitch` branch with master:

```bash 
git merge glitch
```

17. In the glitch console set the remote origin to the master branch of your github project:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/PROJECT.git
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
```

18. In your dev machine, add a dummy test file (like `hello.txt`) and commit it.
19. Push the changes with `git push`. 

If everything is ok, your glitch project should be updated and a `hello.txt` file should appear in the list of files.   
If you don't see it, checkout the log of your glitch project.

## Updating your project from github to glitch

This should be the default method of updating your project. Develop in your dev machine, commit the changes and do a `git push`

## Updating your project from glitch to github

If you change something in glitch, you'll need to first export your project to github and then merge the `glitch` branch with your master branch.
